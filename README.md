# PolyelectrolyteComplexation
1) LAMMPS contain code to generate data file (density=0.04, charge density=0.6, salt concentration=0.5 Molar), an input file needed for LAMMPS. 
2) LAMMPS_2 contain input file, binary data file obtained after running codes in LAMMPS folder, and script to equilibrate the system.
